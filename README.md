# simple_sentiment_text_analysis
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a branch of natural language processing (NLP) that involves the use of computational methods to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. The goal of sentiment analysis is to understand the attitudes, opinions, and emotions conveyed by the text, whether it's positive(+1), negative(-1), or neutral.
